## Problem 2.1

Let $\succ$ be a total well-founded ordering on the ground atoms $p_1,\dots,p_6$ with $p_6 \succ p_5 \succ p_4 \succ p_3 \succ p_2 \succ p_1$. Using the bag extension of $\succ$, compare the clauses

$$
p_6 \vee \neg p_6,\qquad \neg p_2 \vee p_4 \vee p_5,\qquad p_2 \vee p_3.
$$

<summary>Solution</summary>

Totality gives $p_i \succ p_j$ and $p_i \succ \neg p_j$ for $i>j$, so $p_6 \succ \neg p_2, p_4, p_5$ and $p_5 \succ p_2, p_3$. Since $p_6 \vee \neg p_6 \succ p_6$ and $\neg p_2 \vee p_4 \vee p_5 \succ p_5$, we obtain

$$
p_6 \vee \neg p_6 \succ \neg p_2 \vee p_4 \vee p_5 \succ p_2 \vee p_3.
$$

## Problem 2.2

Let $S = \{\neg p \lor \neg q,\ \neg p \lor q,\ p \lor \neg q,\ p \lor q\}$, and fix an ordering with $p \succ q$. Consider the selection function

$$
\{\neg p \lor \underline{\neg q},\ \underline{\neg p} \lor q,\ p \lor \underline{\neg q},\ \underline{p} \lor q\}.
$$

1. Is the selection function well-behaved on $S$? Justify your answer.
2. How many $\mathbb{BR}_\sigma$ inferences are applicable to $S$? Explain.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. A well-behaved function either selects a negative literal or all maximal literals. In the first three clauses the selected literal is negative, and in the last clause $p$ is the unique maximal literal. Hence the selection is well-behaved.
2. No factoring inference applies (no duplicated positive literal). Binary resolution can only use selected literals of opposite polarity; the only pair is $\underline{\neg p} \lor q$ and $\underline{p} \lor q$, yielding $\frac{\underline{\neg p} \lor q \;\;\; \underline{p} \lor q}{q \lor q}(BR)$. Thus exactly one inference is applicable.

## Problem 2.3

Give an example of a non-tautological ground clause with at least one selected literal such that the selection is not well-behaved for any ordering.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Take $p \lor \underline{p}$. The maximal literal must be $p$ under any ordering, but only one occurrence is selected, so the selection can never satisfy the “select all maximal literals” requirement.

## Problem 2.4

Let

$$
S = \{\neg q \lor r,\ \neg p \lor q,\ \neg r \lor \neg q,\ \neg q \lor \neg p,\ \neg p \lor \neg r,\ \neg r \lor p,\ r \lor q \lor p\}.
$$

1. Prove $S$ is unsatisfiable using $\mathbb{BR}$.
2. Encode $S$ in TPTP and use Vampire (run with `-av off`) to prove unsatisfiability.

<details>
<summary>Solution (sketch)</summary>

1. Use binary resolution to derive unit clauses: resolve $\neg q \lor r$ with $\neg r \lor \neg q$ to obtain $\neg q$, then propagate to derive $p$ and $r$, eventually leading to a contradiction when resolving with clauses containing their negations. Any complete derivation is acceptable.
2. Translate each clause into TPTP CNF syntax, run `vampire -av off input.tptp`, and inspect the proof output to confirm the empty clause is produced.
