## Subsumption and Tautology Deletion
A clause is a propositional tautology if it is of the form $p \lor \neg p \lor C$, 
that is, it contains a pair of complementary literals.

There are also <span class="bluebold">equational tautologies</span>, 
for example: 

$$
a\neq b \;\;\lor\;\; b \neq c \;\;\lor\;\; f(c,c)=f(a,a)
$$

A clause $C$ <span class="redbold">subsumes</span> any clause $C \lor D$, where $D$ is non-empty. 

It was known since 1965 that <span class="brownbold">subsumed clauses and propositional tautologies 
can be removed from the search space</span>







## Problem
- How can we <span class="redbold">prove</span> that 
<span class="bluebold">completeness is preserved</span> 
if we <span class="purpbold">remove subsumed clauses and tautologies</span> 
from the <span class="greenbold">search space</span>? 
- Solution: general <span class='redbold'>theory of redundancy</span>.






## Bag Extension of an Ordering
<span class="redbold">Bag = finite multiset</span>. 
Let $\gt$ be any (strict) ordering on a set $X$. 
The <span class="redbold">bag extension of</span> $\gt$ is a binary relation $\gt^\text{bag}$, on bags over $X$, 
defined as the smallest transitive relation on bags such that 

$$
\{x,y_1,\ldots,y_n\} \gt^\text{bag}\{x_1,\ldots,x_m,y_1,\ldots,y_n\}\\
\text{if} \; x>x_i \text{ for all } i\in\{1\ldots m\}
$$

where $m \geq 0$. 

<span class="redbold">Idea</span>: a bag becomes smaller if we replace an element by 
<span class="bluebold">any finite number</span> of smaller elements. 

The following <span class="redbold">results are known</span> about the bag extensions of orderings: 

1. $\gt^\text{bag}$ is an <span class="greenbold">ordering</span>;
2. If $\gt$ is <span class="greenbold">total</span>, then so is $\gt^\text{bag}$; 
3. If $\gt$ is <span class="greenbold">well-founded</span>, then so is $\gt^\text{bag}$.










## Clause Orderings
From now on consider clauses also as <span class="redbold">bags of literals</span>. Note:
- we have an ordering $\succ$ for comparing literals;
- a clause is a bag of literals. 

Hence
- we can compare clauses using the <span class="redbold">bag extension</span> $\succ^\text{bag}$ of $\succ$. 

For simpicity we often denote the multiset ordering also by $\succ$.







### Example
Let $\succ$ be a total well-founded ordering on the ground atoms $p_1, \ldots, p_6$ 
such that $p_6 \succ p_5 \succ p_4 \succ p_3 \succ p_2 \succ p_1$.

Consider the bag extension of $\succ$; 
for simplicity, denote the bag extension of $\succ$ also by $\succ$. 

Using $\succ$, compare and order the following three clauses: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_6 \lor \neg p_6\\
\neg p_2 \lor p_4 \lor p_5\\
p_2 \lor p_3
\end{aligned}
$$







## Redundancy
A clause $C\in S$ is called <span class="redbold">redundant in</span> $S$ if it is a logical consequence of 
clauses in $S$ strictly smaller than $C$.




### Examples
A <span class="redbold">tautology</span> $p \lor \neg p \lor C$ is a logical consequence of the empty set of formulas: 

$$
\models p \lor \neg p \lor C, 
$$

therefore it is <span class="greenbold">redundant</span>. 

We know that $C$ <span class="redbold">subsumes</span> $C \lor D$. Note 

$$
\begin{aligned}
C \lor D \succ C\\
C \models C \lor D
\end{aligned}
$$
therefore subsumed clauses are redundant. 

If $\square \in S$, then all non-empty other clauses in $S$ are <span class="greenbold">redundant</span>.







## Redundant Clauses Can be Removed
In $\mathbb{BR}\sigma$ (and in all calculi we will consider later) 
<span class="bluebold">redundant clauses can be removed from the search space</span>.







## Inference Process with Redundancy
Let $\mathbb{I}$ be an inference system. 
Consider an inference process with two kinds of step $S_i \Rightarrow S_{i+1}$: 
1. <span class="bluebold">Adding the conclusion</span> of an $\mathbb{I}$-inference with premises in $S_i$. 
2. <span class="bluebold">Deletion of a clause redundant</span> in $S_i$, that is

$$
S_{i+1} = S_i - \{C\},
$$

where $C$ is redundant in $S_i$.









## Fairness: Persistent Clauses and Limit
Consider an inference process 

$$
S_0 \Rightarrow S_1 \Rightarrow S_2 \Rightarrow \ldots
$$

A clause $C$ is called <span class="redbold">persistent</span> if 

$$
\exists i \forall j \geq i(C\in S_j).
$$

The <span class="redbold">limit</span> $S_\infty$ of the inference process is the set of all persistent clauses: 

$$
S_\infty = \bigcup_{i=0,1,\ldots}\;\;\;\bigcap_{j\geq i}S_j.
$$









## Fairness
The process is called $\mathbb{I}$<span class="redbold">-fair</span> if every inference with persistent premises 
in $S_\infty$ has been applied, that is, if 

$$
\displaystyle\frac{C_1\;\; \ldots \;\; C_n}{C}
$$

is an inference in $\mathbb{I}$ and $\{C_1,\ldots,C_n\}\subseteq S_\infty$, 
then $C \in S_i$ for some $i$.













## Completeness of $\mathbb{BR}\sigma$
<span class="greenbold">Completeness Theorem.</span> Let $\succ$ be a well-founded ordering and $\sigma$ a well-behaved selection function. Let also 

1. $S_0$ be a set of clauses; 
2. $S_0 \Rightarrow S_1 \Rightarrow S_2 \Rightarrow \ldots$ be a fair $\mathbb{BR}\sigma$-inference process. 

Then $S_0$ is unsatisfiable if and only if $\square \in S_i$ for some $i$.




## Saturation up to Redundancy
A set $S$ of clauses is called <span class="redbold">saturated up to redundancy</span> if for every $\mathbb{I}$-inference

$$
\displaystyle\frac{C_1 \;\;\; \ldots \;\;\; C_n}{C}
$$

with premises in $S$, either 
1. $C \in S$; or 
2. $C$ is redundant w.r.t. $S$, that is, $S_{\prec C} \models C$.






## Saturation up to Redundancy and Satisfiability Checking
<span class="greenbold">Lemma</span>. A set $S$ of clauses saturated up to redundancy is
unsatisfiable if and only if $\square \in S$. 

Therefore, if we built a set saturated up to redundancy, 
then the initial set $S_0$ is <span class="redbold">satisfiable</span>. 
This is a powerful way of checking redundancy: 
one can even check satisfiability of formulas having only <span class="bluebold">infinite models</span>. 

The only problem with this characterisation is that there is <span class="purpbold">no obvious way 
to build a model of</span> $S_0$ out of a saturated set.



## Binary Resolution with Selection
- One of the <span class="redbold">key properties</span> to satisfy this lemma is the following: 
    - <span class="purpbold">the conclusion of every rule is strictly smaller that the rightmost premise of this rule</span>.
- <span class="bluebold">Binary resolution</span>,
    $$
    \displaystyle\frac{\underline{p}\lor C_1 \;\;\; \underline{\neg p} \lor C_2}{C_1 \lor C_2} (BR)
    $$
- <span class="bluebold">Positive factoring</span>,
$$
\displaystyle\frac{\underline{p} \lor \underline{p} \lor C}{p \lor C}{} (Fact)
$$



## First-order logic with equality
- <span class="bluebold">Equality predicate</span>: $=$.
- <span class="bluebold">Equality</span>: $l = r$ . 

The order of literals in equalities does not matter, 
that is, we consider an equality $l = r$ as a multiset consisting of two terms $l, r$,
and so consider $l = r$ and $r = l$ equal.



## Equality. An Axiomatisation (Recap)
- <span class="redbold">reflexivity</span> axiom: $x = x$;
- <span class="redbold">symmetry</span> axiom: $x = y \rightarrow y = x$;
- <span class="redbold">transitivity</span> axiom: $x = y \land y = z \rightarrow x = z$;
- <span class="redbold">function substitution (congruence)</span> axioms: $\\$
$x_1 = y_1 \land \ldots \land x_n = y_n \rightarrow f(x_1, \ldots, x_n ) = f(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$, 
for every function symbol $f$;

- <span class="redbold">predicate substitution (congruence)</span> axioms: $\\$
$x_1 = y_1 \land \ldots \land x_n = y_n \land P(x_1, \ldots, x_n ) \rightarrow P(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$,
for every predicate symbol $P$.



## Inference systems for logic with equality
We will define a <span class="redbold">resolution and superposition inference system</span>. 
This system is <span class="bluebold">complete</span>. One can <span class="bluebold">eliminate redundancy</span>. 

We will first define it only for <span class="bluebold">ground clauses</span>. On the theoretical side,
- Completeness is first proved for <span class="bluebold">ground clauses</span> only.
- It is then “lifted” to <span class="bluebold">arbitrary first-order clauses</span> using a technique called <span class="bluebold">lifting</span>.
- Moreover, this way some notions (ordering, selection function) can first be defined for ground clauses only and then it is relatively easy to see how to generalise them for non-ground clauses.




## Simple Ground Superposition Inference System
<span class="redbold underline">Superposition</span>: (right and left)
$$
\displaystyle \frac{{\color{red}l=r} \lor C \;\;\; {\color{red}s[l] = t} \lor D}{s[r]=t \lor C \lor D}(Sup),\;\;\;\;\;\;
\frac{{\color{red}l=r} \lor C \;\;\; {\color{red}s[l]\neq t} \lor D}{s[r] \neq t \lor C \lor D}(Sup),
$$

<span class="redbold underline">Equality Resolution</span>:
$$
\displaystyle \frac{{\color{red}s\neq s} \lor C}{C}(ER),
$$

<span class="redbold underline">Equality Factoring</span>:
$$
\displaystyle \frac{{\color{red}s=t} \lor {\color{red}s=t'} \lor C}{s=t \lor t \neq t' \lor C}(EF),
$$



## Example
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
f(a)=a \lor g(a)=a \\
f(f(a))=a \lor g(g(a))\neq a\\
f(f(a)) \neq a 
\end{array}
$$




## Can this system be used for efficient theorem proving?
Not really. It has <span class="redbold">too many inferences</span>.
For example, from the clause $f(a) = a$ we can derive any clause of the form 

$$
f^m(a) = f^n(a)
$$ 
where $m, n \geq 0$. 
Worst of all, the derived clauses can be <span class="redbold">much larger</span> than the original clause $f(a) = a$. 

The recipe is to use the previously introduced ingredients: 
1. Ordering; 
2. Literal selection; 
3. Redundancy elimination.
